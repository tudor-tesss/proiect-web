                    <p>Michael Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and
                        dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one
                        of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th
                        century and one of the greatest entertainers of all
                        time. He was also known for his philanthropy, including
                        his support of the civil rights movement and various
                        charities.</p>

                    <p>People love Michael Jackson for the entertainer he was,
                        for the musical genius he was. People were always
                        conflicted by stories in headlines and whether or not
                        there was any truth to them. He was found innocent when
                        he was in court. Jackson had gone from being hailed as
                        the "King of Pop" to the eccentric "Wacko Jacko".</p>
