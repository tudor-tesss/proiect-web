                    Users can create an account and login to the website. To avoid generic
                    security issues such as password phishing and stealing, we have opted to
                    use a passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means
                    that the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
                    receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
                    code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
                    the user will be logged in.

                <p>
                    The I Dislike It! website features a user-friendly interface that is easy
                    to navigate and control. The colour palette is consistent throughout the
                    website and generally follows a 60-30-10 rule, and was chosen to be easy
                    on the eyes and to provide a comforting experience to the user. The use of
                    calming colours such as green helps convey a sense of trust and safety.
                    The website also features a custom scroll bar, which is only available in
                    Chromium based browsers, for now. All of the buttons and links are clearly
                    visible and easy to click on, and the website is responsive and adapts to
                    different screen sizes. Here are some of the key features of the user
                    interface:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clear navigation menus and buttons</li>
                    <li>Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes</li>

                    requirements. However, in order to access the website, users must have a

                    I Dislike It! is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend,
                    and a server-side programming language (Java) and a database management
                    system (PostgreSQL) for the backend. The platform is designed to work with
                    modern web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft

                <h3>5.1 User account management</h3>

                <p>
                    I Dislike It! provides basic account management features, such as creating
                    an account and logging in. For the purpose of this application, we have
                    opted not to use a password-based authentication system, but rather a
                    passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means that
                    the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
                    receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
                    code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
                    the user will be logged in. Furthermore, we have opted not to allow the
                    upload of images on the website, as we believe that this would be a
                    security risk. Since this is, in the end, a platform for expressing
                    opinions, there is always the risk of generating negative feedback, and we
                    do not want to encourage users to upload images that could be used to
                    identify them or other individuals.

                    I Dislike It! is designed to be fast and responsive, with a page load time
                    as short as possible. The website is lightweight and uses a minimal amount

                <p>
                    I Dislike It! takes user privacy and security seriously and thus, in order
                    to avoid any risk of data breaches or leaks, we have opted not to allow
                    the upload of images on the website. For the sign in functionality we are going to use an email
                    based system with
                    which the user will receive a token (that will be used as a password) or a standard password based
                    sign in, but the
                    password will be hashed before being stored in the database to ensure security in case of a data
                    breach.
                    Moreover, the communication between the frontend and the backend will be made using the HTTPS
                    protocol, that encrypts all traffic.

                <h3>6.3 Scalability requirements</h3>

                <p>
                    I Dislike It! is designed to be scalable and can be easily adapted to
                    accommodate a larger number of users. The website is built using a
                    monolithic architecture, which is a good choice for a small website such
                    as this one. However, if the website were to grow in popularity and the
                    number of users were to increase, we could easily migrate to a
                    microservices architecture, which would allow us to scale the website
                    horizontally and to add new features more easily.
