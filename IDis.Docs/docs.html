    <h2 id="system-features">3. System Features</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Account management</h3>

    <p>
        Users can create an account and login to the website. To avoid generic
        security issues such as password phishing and stealing, we have opted to
        use a passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means
        that the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
        receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
        code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
        the user will be logged in.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Landing page (categories overview)</h3>

    <p>
        The landing page, or the categories overview page, is a page that displays
        all the categories that are available on the website. The categories are
        displayed in a grid with their name. The user can click on a category to
        access all of the posts in that category.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Category overview</h3>

    <p>
        Upon entering this page, users will be greeted with a list of all the
        posts in the category. The posts are displayed in a single column, and
        contain the title, the author, the rating criteria and the ratings given
        by the author, and the description of the post. The user can click on a
        post to view it in more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 Post overview</h3>

    <p>
        Upon accessing this page, users will be greeted with a post, which
        contains the title, the author, the rating criteria and the ratings given
        by the author, and the description of the post. The user can also see all
        the replies to the post, along with the authors and ratings of the new
        replies. The user may also reply to the post and express their own
        opinion.
    </p>

    <h3>3.5 Create category</h3>

    <p>
        Registered users can add new categories, which will be displayed on the
        landing page. The category name must be unique. The category must also
        contain between one and five rating criteria.
    </p>

    <h3>3.6 Add post</h3>

    <p>
        While viewing a category, registered users can add new posts to the
        category. The post must contain a title, a description, and a rating for
        each of the rating criteria.
    </p>

    <h3>3.7 Add reply</h3>

    <p>
        While viewing a post, registered users can add new replies to the post.
        The reply must contain a description, and a rating for each of the rating
        criteria.
    </p>

        statistics will be available in CSV, DocBook or PDF format.
    </p>

    <h2 id="external-interface-requirements">
        4. External Interface Requirements
    </h2>

    <h3>4.1 User interfaces</h3>

    <p>
        The I Dislike It! website features a user-friendly interface that is easy
        to navigate and control. The colour palette is consistent throughout the
        website and generally follows a 60-30-10 rule, and was chosen to be easy
        on the eyes and to provide a comforting experience to the user. The use of
        calming colours such as green helps convey a sense of trust and safety.
        The website also features a custom scroll bar, which is only available in
        Chromium based browsers, for now. All of the buttons and links are clearly
        visible and easy to click on, and the website is responsive and adapts to
        different screen sizes. Here are some of the key features of the user
        interface:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Clear navigation menus and buttons</li>
        <li>Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes</li>
        <li>Readable fonts and colors</li>
        <li>Pleasant colour palette</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</h3>

    <p>
        The I Dislike It! may use external APIs, such as SendGrid, to send emails
        to users.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Hardware interfaces</h3>

    <p>
        As a web-based application, I Dislike It! does not have any hardware
        requirements. However, in order to access the website, users must have a
        device with a web browser installed, and an internet connection.
    </p>

    <h3>4.4 Software interfaces</h3>

    <p>
        I Dislike It! is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend,
        and a server-side programming language (Java) and a database management
        system (PostgreSQL) for the backend. The platform is designed to work with
        modern web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft
        Edge.
    </p>
    <h2 id="system-features">5. System Features</h2>

    <h3>5.1 User account management</h3>

    <p>
        I Dislike It! provides basic account management features, such as creating
        an account and logging in. For the purpose of this application, we have
        opted not to use a password-based authentication system, but rather a
        passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means that
        the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
        receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
        code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
        the user will be logged in. Furthermore, we have opted not to allow the
        upload of images on the website, as we believe that this would be a
        security risk. Since this is, in the end, a platform for expressing
        opinions, there is always the risk of generating negative feedback, and we
        do not want to encourage users to upload images that could be used to
        identify them or other individuals.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Categories overview</h3>

    <p>
        Users can browse the various categories that are available on the website
        and may also filter the categories by name. Additionally, users can search
        for categories by name.
    </p>

    <h3>5.3 Category overview</h3>

    <p>
        Registered users can view all of the posts in a certain category and, if
        they desire, they can press the "Add post" button to add a new post to the
        category. The posts are displayed in a single column, and contain the
        title, the author, the rating criteria and the ratings given by the
        author, and the description of the post. The user can click on a post to
        view it in more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>5.4 Post overview</h3>

    <p>
        Users can view a post in more detail. The post contains the title, the
        author, the rating criteria and the ratings given by the author, and the
        description of the post. The user can also see all the replies to the
        post, along with the authors and ratings of the new replies. The user may
        also reply to the post and express their own opinion.
    </p>

    <h3>5.5 Statistics</h3>

    <p>
        Registered users can view statistics for a category or a post. The
        statistics are displayed in a CSV, DocBook or PDF format. These statistics
        can include the average rating for a category, the average ratings for a
        post, the number of posts in a category, a graph of the ratings for a
        category, and a graph of the ratings for a post.
    </p>

    <h3>5.6 Notifications</h3>

    <p>
        Users can receive notifications by email, for the purpose of allowing
        authentication.
    </p>

    <h3>5.7 Administrator dashboard</h3>

    <p>
        Administrators have access to a special dashboard that allows them to
        manage the platform. The dashboard includes functionality to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>View and delete posts or categories</li>
        <li>View and manage user accounts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="other-non-functional-requirements">
        6. Other Non-Functional Requirements
    </h2>

    <h3>6.1 Performance requirements</h3>

    <p>
        I Dislike It! is designed to be fast and responsive, with a page load time
        as short as possible. The website is lightweight and uses a minimal amount
        of resources, allowing it to run smoothly on a wide range of devices.
    </p>

    <h3>6.2 Security requirements</h3>

    <p>
        I Dislike It! takes user privacy and security seriously and thus, in order
        to avoid any risk of data breaches or leaks, we have opted not to allow
        the upload of images on the website and we have also opted not to allow
        the use of passwords for authentication.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 Scalability requirements</h3>

    <p>
        I Dislike It! is designed to be scalable and can be easily adapted to
        accommodate a larger number of users. The website is built using a
        monolithic architecture, which is a good choice for a small website such
        as this one. However, if the website were to grow in popularity and the
        number of users were to increase, we could easily migrate to a
        microservices architecture, which would allow us to scale the website
        horizontally and to add new features more easily.
