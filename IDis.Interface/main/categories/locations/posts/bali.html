                    <p>Bali is an island and province of Indonesia. The province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. It is located at the westernmost end of the Lesser Sunda Islands, between Java to the west and Lombok to the east. Its capital, Denpasar, is located in the southern part of the island. Bali is one of the country's 34 provinces with the highest global recognition. The province has a population of 4,225,000 people, and the island has a population of 3,890,757. The island is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. According to the 2010 Census, 83.5% of Bali's population adhered to Balinese Hinduism, 13.4% adhered to Islam, 1.7% adhered to Christianity, and 1.4% adhered to Buddhism. Bali is a popular tourist destination, which has seen a significant rise in tourists since the 1980s. The main tourist gateway has been Denpasar International Airport, Bali's largest airport, located at Ngurah Rai. Bali was inhabited around 2000 BC by Austronesian people who migrated originally from Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia and Melanesia. Bali was one of the earliest Hindu areas in Indonesia. The island was a key location for the spread of Hinduism in Indonesia. The first major inscription dates to 778 AD. It was during the reign of the Warmadewa dynasty that Bali became a prosperous Hindu kingdom. The first Hindu-Balinese king was named Warmadewa, and his son Mahendradatta was the first to convert to Mahayana Buddhism. The subsequent king, Udayana, made Bali the centre of the Hindu universe. The name "Bali" is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit word "Vallabhi", meaning "the one who is loved". The name "Bali" is also used in the name of a popular dance genre, Barong Bali, which is a form of dance-drama derived from the mythology of the island.
