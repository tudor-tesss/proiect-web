                    Users can create an account and login to the website. To avoid generic
                    security issues such as password phishing and stealing, we have opted to
                    use a passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means
                    that the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
                    receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
                    code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
                    the user will be logged in.

                    The I Dislike It! website features a user-friendly interface that is easy
                    to navigate and control. The colour palette is consistent throughout the
                    website and generally follows a 60-30-10 rule, and was chosen to be easy
                    on the eyes and to provide a comforting experience to the user. The use of
                    calming colours such as green helps convey a sense of trust and safety.
                    The website also features a custom scroll bar, which is only available in
                    Chromium based browsers, for now. All of the buttons and links are clearly

                <p>
                    I Dislike It! provides basic account management features, such as creating
                    an account and logging in. For the purpose of this application, we have
                    opted not to use a password-based authentication system, but rather a
                    passwordless authentication system, based on email gates. This means that
                    the user, upon entering their email address on the sign in page, will
                    receive an email with a code. Then, they will be prompted to enter the
                    code in the website and we will verify that the code is correct. If it is,
                    the user will be logged in. Furthermore, we have opted not to allow the
                    upload of images on the website, as we believe that this would be a
                    security risk. Since this is, in the end, a platform for expressing
                    opinions, there is always the risk of generating negative feedback, and we
                    do not want to encourage users to upload images that could be used to
                    identify them or other individuals.

                    I Dislike It! takes user privacy and security seriously and thus, in order
                    to avoid any risk of data breaches or leaks, we have opted not to allow
                    the upload of images on the website. For the sign in functionality we are going to use an email

                    which the user will receive a token (that will be used as a password) or a standard password based
                    sign in, but the
                    password will be hashed before being stored in the database to ensure security in case of a data
                    breach.
                    Moreover, the communication between the frontend and the backend will be made using the HTTPS

                    microservices architecture, which would allow us to scale the website
                    horizontally and to add new features more easily.

                <ul>Colors:The application utilizes a color scheme based on blues in light mode and grays in dark mode. In light mode, shades of blue are used to create a visually pleasing and vibrant experience. In dark mode, various shades of gray are employed to provide a visually appealing and comfortable interface.</ul>

                    <ul>Typography: Thoughtful typography choices ensure readability and visual hierarchy. Clear and legible fonts are used to enhance user comprehension and ease of use.</ul>

                        <ul>Icons: Appropriate icons are utilized to enhance user understanding and provide visual cues. Icons are selected based on their relevance and consistency with the overall design.</ul>

                    The application features a Dark Mode option that provides a visually appealing and comfortable interface
                    for users who prefer a darker color scheme. Dark Mode is consistent throughout the site, maintaining a
                    unified visual experience across different pages and components.
                </p>

                <h4>7.3.1 Implementation and Theme Storage</h4>

                <p>
                    The Dark Mode theme preference is stored in the user's browser using the Local Storage API.
                    When a user enables Dark Mode, their preference is saved, allowing the application to remember
                    and apply the Dark Mode theme consistently across subsequent visits.

                </p>

                <h4>7.3.2 Benefits of Dark Mode</h4>

                <p>

                    <ul>Reduced Eye Strain: The darker color scheme reduces the amount of bright light emitted by the screen, which can alleviate eye strain and fatigue, particularly during extended usage.</ul>
                    <ul> Battery Efficiency (for OLED Displays): On devices with OLED displays, Dark Mode can potentially save battery life as individual pixels can be turned off or dimmed, resulting in lower power consumption.</ul>
                    <ul>Visual Aesthetics: Dark Mode provides a sleek and modern look</ul>

                    <h3>8.3.1 Backend Architecture</h3>

                    <p>
                        The back-end server was built on Java, using a custom-built framework (explanations regarding the framework are below) and using a PostgreSQL database. The back-end code was structured following the Domain-Driven Design approach and on a monolithic design. As part of developing the back-end, the Test Driven Development design pattern was used, ensuring that all of the created features, on both the domain and business levels, are thoroughly tested. Furthermore, a custom Mediator was used in order to reduce code coupling (check framework docs). The backend server was also built to follow the REST paradigm and features the following resources (root level):
                        <ul>
                            <li>categories</li>
                            <li>posts</li>
                            <li>users</li>
                            <li>rss</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>8.3.2 Framework</h3>

                    <p>
                        For the backend server, we have developed a custom framework, specific to our needs. These are the main features of the framework:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                HttpServer:
                                The HttpServer is a class built upon Java’s native HttpServer implementation and customized for our specific needs. This HttpServer will be given a certain port and a list of controllers to use.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                            <li>
                                Controllers:
                                Each controller class must implement the IController interface, which is an empty interface used for the sole purpose of identifying the controllers. Each controller class contains a list of methods representing endpoints, each annotated with the @Route(path = “.......”, method = HttpVerbs.[yourVerbHere]) and @Controller(name = “.....”). These custom-built annotations help define the specifics of the endpoint, such as the route, method and name.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                            <li>
                                Router:
                                The Router class is responsible for intercepting the Http requests and then forwarding them to the appropriate endpoint, based on the route and http verb received. This Router implementation also permits the use of route parameters, such as in the above-described routes (i.e., posts/{id}). The route parameter will be matched to a corresponding parameter of the endpoint method.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                                The Mediator is a feature inspired from Jimmy Bogard’s <a href="https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR">MediatR</a> library for C#. This Mediator acts as a “hub”, facilitating the communication between the endpoint method and the Command Handler, but without directly referencing the Command Handler class in the endpoint method, to reduce code coupling. Each Command implements the IRequest<T> interface, and that T type is to be replaced with the return type of the handler. The Command Handler class must implement the IRequestHandler<T, V> interface, where T is to be replaced with the command class and V with the return type, the same as the Command. In the Main class, where all configuration happens, the commands and handlers must be declared for the Mediator and, then, when mediator.send(command) is called, the Mediator will be able to forward that command to the appropriate handler, if one exists.

                                The Database class is a custom implementation and acts as a point of creating connections to the database. For this, we have used Hikari, in order to use connection pooling to prevent blocking calls to the database due to the jdbc driver. The QueryProvider class acts kind of like a repository, and contains generic methods which are used to insert entities, get all entities of a certain type, or get an entity of a certain type by id.

                    <h3>8.3.3 Frontend Architecture</h3>

                    The front-end code is structured in a modular design, split into services, looks, models, errors, routes and components. Each page accessed represents a Component (i.e: PostOverviewComponent is the page where you view a post and its replies). Furthermore, since each component needs to call at least one endpoint, we have created a number of services in the shared component, in order to reduce code duplication and decrease the package size and increase performance. A short summary of the responsibilities of each “module”:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            components: the components represent pages and their custom build javascript code, along with the html and css files.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            services: services are javascript classes which, each, represent one of the controller classes in the backend (authentication, categories, posts, statistics, users). Each of these services contains methods that make a call to the backend server and return the response either in the form of an Error, or in the form of a model.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            models: the models are javascript classes which represent our Domain objects (i.e: post, user, etc…)  and act as containers for data, to maintain a more organized code.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            errors: the errors class is a collection of all of the possible errors which can be returned from the backend and is used to display custom messages for each error. In case an unexpected error comes from the backend, an appropriate message will be displayed.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            look: the look module contains the “behind the scenes” work for the dark mode implementation and for certain pop-ups.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            routes: the routes class is a collection of all of the routes available in the backend and has the possibility of switching the prefix (from localhost to the host which hosts our backend server), to accommodate running either on localhost or on the web.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>8.3.4 Docker and Deployment</h3>

                    <p>
                        As part of this project, we have also created Dockerfiles in order to run our backend and frontend apps and our database in Docker containers. The backend server runs on an Ubuntu container, and the frontend container runs with the help of an Nginx server, and the database is a separate PostgreSQL container. With these dockerfiles, we also had the possibility of deploying the web-app on a dedicated host in a very simple manner. For deployment we have chosen <a href="https://northflank.com">Northflank</a> as our provider, as it offered a free tier for small apps, and it was relatively easy to configure.
